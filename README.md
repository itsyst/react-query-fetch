# React with Chakra UI, Vite, TypeScript, and React Query

### In this project, we are utilizing:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Chakra UI: A simple, modular, and accessible component library for React.
- Vite: A next-generation frontend tool that provides fast development and a smooth build experience.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that offers static typing to help manage complex applications.
- React Query: A powerful library for managing server-side data in React applications, offering enhanced caching, paginated fetching, and optimizations, compared to Redux.

### Key Features

- Infinite Scroll:
    - Implemented using React Query to fetch and manage paginated data seamlessly.
    - Allows users to load more data by scrolling without reloading the entire page.

- State Management:
    - Leveraging React Query for managing server state rather than Redux, providing a simpler and more optimized approach for fetching, caching, and manipulating data.

- Chakra UI:
    - Using Chakra UI for responsive, accessible, and themable UI components that enhance the user experience.

- TypeScript:
    - Helps ensure type safety, reducing common bugs associated with traditional JavaScript and providing better code maintainability.
